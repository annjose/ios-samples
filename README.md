This repository contains the iOS samples from tutorials or blogs that I have read in the past. I have tried out these samples to understand the concepts well.

## Infinite Scrolling Sample
This is a sample that demonstrates how to implement infinite scrolling, a common UI paradigm that allows the user to scroll through an (illusional) infinite list of items like photos, tweets etc. This sample was made based on a really good article https://michiganlabs.com/ios/development/2016/11/10/ios-infinite-scrolling/

## Storyboard vs. Programmatic UI
This sample project shows how to build a login screen using Storyboard vs. programmatically.
