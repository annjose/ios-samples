# ios-samples
This repository contains the iOS samples from tutorials or blogs that I have read in the past. I have tried out these samples to understand the concepts well.

## Infinite Scrolling Sample
This is a sample that demonstrates how to implement infinite scrolling, a common UI paradigm that allows the user to scroll through an (illusional) infinite list of items like photos, tweets etc. This sample was made based on a really good article https://michiganlabs.com/ios/development/2016/11/10/ios-infinite-scrolling/

## Programmatic UI sample
This sample project shows how to build a login screen using Storyboard vs. programmatically.

## UIStackView sample
This sample shows how to build a UI using UIStackView which was introduced in iOS 10. The project folder contains two versions of the project - the original version that uses regular constraints, and the modified version that uses UIStackView. You can see how flexible the design has become when UIStackView was used.
This sample was made from [Ray Wenderlich's UIStackView tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/160646/uistackview-tutorial-introducing-stack-views-2)
